"""Synthetic TEMPORAL overlay — per-twin activity rhythm (Phase B1, for H8b).

The static multiplex (contact + OSINT) is BLIND to a compromised in-graph account: a
taken-over known contact passes every static layer (it really is a known sender). The
signal is *dynamic* — the malicious email arrives OFF the sender's usual rhythm. This
overlay gives each twin a deterministic activity profile (a subset of time buckets it is
normally active in) so an experiment can:
  * place a benign email IN the sender's active buckets (temporally consistent), and
  * place a compromised email OFF them (the attacker operates off-pattern),
and test whether a temporal-consistency feature recovers the AUC~0.51 blind spot.

Also exposes a CO-ACTIVITY layer (twins sharing active buckets) as a multiplex layer.

Deterministic (hash-seeded; no random/datetime). Pure stdlib. Mirrors the controlled
design of build_osint_overlay (tunable, ground-truth, ethics-free).
