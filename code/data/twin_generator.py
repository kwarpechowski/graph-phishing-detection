"""Synthetic digital-twin generator — the MVP data path (no OSINT, no real people).

PIVOT (synthetic-twin MVP)
--------------------------
The active data path of this study uses **synthetic digital twins**, not OSINT on
real subjects. A *twin* is an LLM-fabricated persona that fills the C1..C8 victim
taxonomy (see ``taxonomy.CATEGORY_FIELDS``). Eight canonical personas C1..C8 plus
a synthetic "normal mailbox" (the personal-baseline benign corpus) are generated
**agentically** by the LLM and *grounded* on public corpora (Enron) via simple
distributional statistics, so the twins look plausible without copying anyone.

Why this removes the ethics burden
-----------------------------------
Twins are **entirely synthetic**: there is no real data subject, so there is **no
consent, no RODO/GDPR, no IRB** to obtain — those gates only apply to the FUTURE
real-data path (``data/build_profiles.py`` + ``data/plugins/*``, now deprecated /
out of MVP scope). Every twin is marked ``synthetic=True`` and carries
``consent=True`` *vacuously* (synthetic ⇒ nothing to consent to). The C7
(persuasion-susceptibility) special-category concern likewise does not apply to a
fabricated persona, so ``c7_consent=True`` is set for twins.

Determinism
-----------
Nothing here touches ``datetime`` / ``random`` at import time. ``generate_twin``
is deterministic given (``twin_id``, ``seed_stats``) **when** the LLM client is
seeded / temperature-0 — the prompt is fully derived from those inputs. A canned
client (used in tests) makes the whole path deterministic and offline.

    Used to *ground* synthetic generation on a public corpus (mean message length,
    vocabulary richness) so twins read like genuine workplace mail. This is the
    public-data calibration step that lets us claim the synthetic twins are
    grounded rather than free-floating.

    Returns ``None`` if Enron is not downloaded/extracted yet (callers then run
    ungrounded). When present it returns e.g.::

        {"mean_chars": 812.4, "vocab_richness": 0.41, "n_messages": 1530,
         "n_users": 10, "source": "enron"}

    -----
    Reuses :func:`data.load_enron.parse_maildir`. No network I/O here — it only
    reads an already-extracted maildir. If Enron has not been fetched
    (``data/download_public.py --enron``), it returns ``None``.
